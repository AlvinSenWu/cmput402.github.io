# Communication Expectations

Ask questions well before Assignment due dates. Although you have nothing to lose by trying, realize that while the course staff try to provide as much support as possible, they are not obliged to answer last-minute questions (i.e., those within less than 2 business days from the assignment due date). 

Please be polite and courteous. We will not tolerate impolite comments or harassments of any sort on the course forum or to any of the course staff.

# Where to get help?

* Questions about assignments/projects: Discussion Forum
* Due dates: Discussion Forum
* Requirements: Discussion Forum
* Anything where another student might have the same question: Discussion Forum
* Questions about the material covered in lecture/labs: Discussion forum
* Individual help with assignments/projects:
    * You can get help **during the labs!**
    * You can attend the **office hours of a TA.**
    * You can attend the office hours of your instructor.
* Personal questions about you or your mark: Contact the [instructor]({filename}/general/outline.md#contact-information)
* Complaints: Contact the [instructor]({filename}/general/outline.md#contact-information)
* ReMarking requests: Contact the [instructor]({filename}/general/outline.md#contact-information)
    * TAs will not help you with your marks, even if they're the one who marked it.

# Discussion Forum

**Questions related to the course and course material, especially if the answer could help another student!**

ðŸš€ Posting to the forum increases your changes of a **quick response** since any of the course staff or your classmates are able to answer. ðŸŒ 

Unless your question is personal (E.g., you are feeling unwell and require an EA, you have a question about your mark), all questions should be posted on the Discussion Forum first. Please do not share code from your implementations (configuration settings are OK). 

* Do not post your code. 
    * Configuration settings are OK.
* Do not post your solutions.
* Post only questions related to **this course**.
* Be polite, this is not a complaint forum.

The discussion forum is on the eClass.

# Office Hours

If your question is related to implementation/configuration issues in the projects/assignments, the TAs are best suited to help you. You can attend TA office hours remotely. **TAs do not provide help outside of Labs and Scheduled Office Hours.**

If your question is related to content covered in class and you need further explanation, please post on the disucssion forum.
